      "A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: a quantum computer exploits superposed and entangled states and the (non-deterministic) outcomes of quantum measurements as features of its computation. Ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate, by contrast, using deterministic rules. Any classical computer can, in principle, be replicated using a (classical) mechanical device such as a Turing machine, with at most a constant-factor slowdown in timeâ€”unlike quantum computers, which are believed to require exponentially more resources to simulate classically. It is widely believed that a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. Theoretically, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing.[1] However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, a state that is in an abstract sense \"between\" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.\n",
      "Quantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.\n",

       "{'text': 'A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: a quantum computer exploits superposed and entangled states and the (non-deterministic) outcomes of quantum measurements as features of its computation. Ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate, by contrast, using deterministic rules. Any classical computer can, in principle, be replicated using a (classical) mechanical device such as a Turing machine, with at most a constant-factor slowdown in timeâ€”unlike quantum computers, which are believed to require exponentially more resources to simulate classically. It is widely believed that a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. Theoretically, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing.[1] However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, a state that is in an abstract sense \"between\" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.\\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.\\nFor many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities.[2] Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales,[3][4] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.[5] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography,[6] and quantum physics was essential for nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.[7]\\n\\nAs physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.[8] When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,[9] prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.[10][11][12] In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.[13][14]\\n\\nQuantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch\\'s algorithm in 1985,[15] the Bernsteinâ€“Vazirani algorithm in 1993,[16] and Simon\\'s algorithm in 1994.[17] These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.[18]\\n\\n\\nPeter Shor (pictured here in 2017) showed in 1994 that a scalable quantum computer would be able to break RSA encryption.\\nPeter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffieâ€“Hellman encryption protocols,[19] which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover\\'s algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem.[20][21] The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,[22] validating Feynman\\'s 1982 conjecture.[23]\\n\\nOver the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.[24] In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,[25][26] and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.[24]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
